This project is a habit tracking app designed to help users build consistency by keeping daily and weekly routines in one place. This app provides a simple “Today” dashboard, quick daily check-ins, and progress insights (streaks and completion rates) so users can clearly see what to do next and how they’re improving over time.

The core functionality of this project is adding habits and keeping track of whether you have completed them or not. The Progress Dashboard shows percentages of habits completed in the past 7 or 30 days, with blue meaning complete, and yellow meaning incomplete. It also has a streak counter and tells you out of the last 7 or 30 days what percentage of your habits you have completed overall and individually.
